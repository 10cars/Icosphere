Demo/Tutorial on how to programmatically draw an Icosphere.

What you get:
- adjustable levels of refinement
- choose between two different shaders to see the mesh with "hard edges" or interpolated normals to render a "smoothed" sphere
- spin the sphere around to look at it from all angles
- and of course, feel free to fork me on GitHub https://github.com/10cars/Icosphere
